## Final Project Description

Our goal was to build a simple task management tool similar to [Trello](https://trello.com/en).
If you haven't heard about Trello up until now, now would be a good time to go check it out.

## Project Overview

In this section, you'll find relevant project information and a getting started guide.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm install` in the root to download & install required dependencies
3. run these 2 commands in separate terminal windows:

- `npm run start:server` to start `json-server-based` backend
- `npm run start:client` to start development server

4. open the url you see in the terminal where you ran `npm run start:client` (should look like `http://localhost:3000`)
5. Enjoy our reboard
